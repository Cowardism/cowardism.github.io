                                Terrorism has claimed countless number of innocent lives, disrupted international peace 
                                and has impacted on economies across the globe. Many nations have grappled with terrorism for decades without truly understanding
                                what keeps fuelling it.
                                And the frequency of such terrorist attacks has significantly increased over the last
                                decade<a href="#references"><sup>1</sup></a>. It is more important now than ever for us to
                                understand what drives terrorism and how we can effectively combat terrorism at a global scale!
                                <br /><br />
                                We believe the first step in tackling terrorism is understanding the issues in categorising
                                this heinous crime under the label of “terrorism”. Currently as it stands, there is no internationally
                                accepted definition of “terrorism”. The UN has been attempting to define “terrorism” for over two decades
                                now, but is yet to reach consensus on the definition. The primary disagreement seems to be in distinguishing
                                terrorism from legitimate liberation movements. In 2010, the Head of the UN Counter-Terrorism
                                Committee Executive Directorate had said “nations are hampered by an inability to define and criminalise
                                terrorism”<a href="#references"><sup>2</sup></a>. Unfortunately, this remains an issue today!

                                <h3 style="text-align: center; color: black !important;">What is it about the word <em>“Terrorism”</em>?</h3>
                                <div class="separator transparent"></div>
                                <p style="color: black !important;">
                                    The definition of the term “terrorism” is highly subjective depending on the political party or
                                    ideological group that is defining it. The well-known slogan "One man’s terrorist is another man’s
                                    freedom fighter” highlights the subjectiveness of the term. From an international criminal law perspective,
                                    Dr Ben Saul has noted that the term “currently
                                    lacks the precision, objectivity and certainty demanded by legal discourse”<a href="#references"><sup>3</sup></a>.
                                    The political connotations of the term also make it difficult for it to be admitted
                                    into international law.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Furthermore, criminal law needs to be able to clearly express condemnation of the crime and to stigmatise the
                                    perpetrators. But does the label “terrorism” have sufficient capacity to stigmatise the crime? From
                                    the perspective of the terrorist organisation and their sympathisers, the term “terrorism” is
                                    synonymous with terms such as “freedom fighters” or “jihadists”. This together with the conflicting
                                    and subjective definitions around the term “terrorism”, one can conclude that the term would be
                                    ineffective in stigmatising the crime. This is in stark contrast to the clear
                                    stigmatisation that is associated with other crime labels such as rape, child molestation, murder,
                                    manslaughter…etc.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Instead of stigmatising the crime, many believe the term “terrorism” in fact glorifies the crime! Osama Bin
                                    Laden has said “The terrorism we practice is of the most commendable kind for it is directed at
                                    tyrants…”. ISIS have openly created online resources that encourage “terrorism” - proudly using that
                                    same term. Dr Scott Smith has noted "The word 'terror' implies power and the word 'terrorist' grants 
                                    undeserved status and identity"<a href="#references"><sup>9</sup></a>. It seems the term in itself has now 
                                    become part of the propaganda of terrorist organisations!
                                    <br /><br />
                                    It is clear that what is needed is a better term that can be used to objectively categorise this horrendous
                                    crime without any political bias, and without any doubt in terms of its
                                    capacity to stigmatise the crime...

                                <p>
                                    <br>What is the true nature of the crime which we currently refer to as “terrorism”? Is it not the cowardly act of killing/injuring innocent and unarmed civilians – including children? Let's take a closer look at the meaning behind the word “cowardly”. The English Oxford dictionary defines “cowardly” as:
                                </p>
                                <div class="dictionary-quote">
                                    <strong>cowardly:</strong>
                                    <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                                        <span style="font-style: italic;">adjective.</span> 1. Lacking courage. 2 (of an action) carried out against a person who is unable to retaliate. <span style="font-style: italic;">“a cowardly attack on a helpless victim”</span>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <br />
                                <p>
                                    Based on that definition, we propose the introduction of 2 new words into our vocabulary which we believe are better alternatives to “terrorism” and “terrorist”:
                                </p>
                                <div class="dictionary-quote">
                                    <strong>cowardism:</strong>

                                    <strong>cowardist:</strong>
                                    <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                                        <span style="font-style: italic;">noun.</span> A person that carries out a cowardly attack that is targeting unarmed civilians as means of coercion.

                                <p>
                                    Note 1: The term “cowardly” is used here to signify that it is a deliberate attack on unarmed civilians or
                                    non-combatants – those who are unable to retaliate or defend themselves. It is also “cowardly” in the sense that
                                    the perpetrator is avoiding direct military engagement - and choosing to attack soft targets instead.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Note 2: The above terms do not imply that the attacker is a coward. In fact, they may well 
                                    consider themselves to be very brave individuals who have a deep commitment to their cause. 
                                    However, they have chosen the <em>cowardly</em> 
                                    tactic of attacking soft targets such as unarmed civilians, children, babies…etc while avoiding 
                                    military engagement. Hence the labels of "cowardism" and "cowardist" would perfectly fit the 
                                    crime and the criminal. 
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Note 3: This definition doesn't stipulate any particular type of “coercion”. That is, it applies
                                    for all types of coercion whether it be political, religious, ideological driven, self-determination
                                    driven...etc. Any cowardly attack to kill or maim civilians is to be regarded
                                    as unjustified no matter what the cause. If a self-determination, rebellion or a revolutionary
                                    movement has to resort to cowardism, that movement is not only illegitimate, it is also in violation
                                    of humanitarian law (which explicitly condones the killing or injuring of civilians)!

                                    Terrorism expert Walter Laqueur believes the term “terrorism” needs to be replaced: “The term
                                    terrorism has come to encompass such wide varieties of violent acts that it should be replaced
                                    by another term”<a href="#references"><sup>4</sup></a>. Not only is it a disputed term, it also does not have the capacity
                                    to sufficiently stigmatise the crime or to express the public's disgust of the cowardly attack
                                    on unarmed civilians. In fact, we’d argue that it glorifies the crime!

                                        We are advocating the use of the term “Cowardism” to be used instead of “Terrorism” – In fact, we
                                        believe that it is not possible for us to win the war against terrorism until we have such a change
                                        in our vocabulary! Clear arguments in favour of this change:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                                        <li style="color: black !important; list-style-type: square;">The term “cowardism” has significantly more capacity to stigmatise the crime than the disputed term “terrorism”.</li>
                                        <li style="color: black !important; list-style-type: square;">The term “cowardism” is not subjective and not open for interpretation. It simply represents an attack that targets unarmed civilians as means of coercion. It doesn’t attempt to qualify the reasons behind the coercion either and doesn’t discriminate on whether the perpetrator is a state or non-state actor. </li>
                                        <li style="color: black !important; list-style-type: square;">The term “cowardism” will clearly convey the public’s disgust and condemnation of this crime. Even if terrorist organisations refer to these attacks by other names such as “martyrdom operations” or "jihad", the strong symbolism associated with the term “cowardist” (when wielded by the public and media) will always have an overarching influence in shaming and deterring the perpetrator.</li>
                                        <li style="color: black !important; list-style-type: square;">The term “cowardism” will break the symbiotic relationship that is known to exist between terrorist organisations and the media (more details on this below)</li>
                                        <li style="color: black !important; list-style-type: square;">The term “cowardism” will evoke a more rational response to the crime, whereas "terrorism" tends to evoke fear and panic - which can often turn into prejudice against minorities and subsequent hate crime.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p style="color: black !important;">
                                        <br />
                                        Trillions have been spent on counterterrorism efforts around the globe. However, instead of a decline in 
                                        terrorism incidents, we are seeing a significant increase in the frequency of such attacks! Obviously our
                                        current global strategies against terrorism are not effective...
                                        <br /><br />
                                        It is now time for a new approach! We believe redefining our terrorism laws through the use of the new
                                        term of "cowardism" is the key. Once the term of "cowardism" is admitted into international criminal law,
                                        it will enter into the vocabulary used by the media and the general public. This will then passively drive the
                                        deterrence of terrorist attacks at a global scale!

                                        </h3>
                                        Experts agree that there are several issues in referring to this heinous crime under the label of "terrorism":
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>UN's "Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism" has been unable to reach agreement on the definition of "terrorism" even after 20 years of negotiations!</li>
                                            <li>To this very day, there is no comprehensive definition on terrorism that is recognised by International Criminal Law. This is primarily due to the fact that the term "terrorism" is subjective and politically charged. </li>
                                            <li>From the perspective of terrorist organisations and their sympathisers, the term “terrorism” is synonymous with terms such as “freedom fighters” or “jihadists”. This dual perception and subjectiveness of the label of "terrorism" implies that it has very little capacity to stigmatise the crime.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>We believe it is time we abandon this futile exercise in defining "terrorism" and look towards a better solution!</p>

                                            Proposed Solution:

                                        <p>
                                            We want the UN to adopt the new term "cowardism" as a base for defining and criminalising terrorism:

                                            The term “cowardly” is used here to signify that it is a deliberate attack on unarmed civilians or
                                            non-combatants – those who are unable to retaliate or defend themselves. It is also “cowardly” in the sense 
                                            that the perpetrator is avoiding direct military engagement - and choosing to attack soft targets instead.

                                        </h3>
                                        The new term of "cowardism" will:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Apply clear stigmatisation to the crime which will lead to a significant drop in terrorist attacks</li>
                                            <li>Enable clear labelling of the crime without subjectiveness or political bias</li>
                                            <li>Enable the media to continue to report on the crime without it becoming free publicity for terrorist organisations. In fact, once media starts referring to these attacks as "cowardist attacks", it will become negative publicity for terrorist organisations!</li>
                                            <li>Enable us to leave behind the 20-year-old stalemate in attempting to define "terrorism" and look at the problem from a new perspective.</li>
                                            <li>Provide clear condemnation of its use as a tactic of war. Once cowardism is ruled out, there will be a better chance of resolving conflict through legitimate political engagement. In the absence of cowardism, communication channels and dialog will open up - this will in turn reveal avenues that were previously unthinkable in building lasting peace!</li>

                                </h1>
                                <p>
                                    <br />

                                    It is well known that terrorists seek publicity through their acts of violence<a href="#references"><sup>5</sup></a>. Coincidentally,
                                    a symbiotic relationship can often be observed between media and terrorist organisations<a href="#references"><sup>6</sup></a>. As
                                    Prof Taha Najem has pointed out "The broader and more prolonged the media coverage of terrorism turns
                                    out to be, the greater the terrorists' feelings of accomplishment, influence, and power".
                                    <br /><br />
                                    We believe the use of the term “cowardism” will break this symbiotic
                                    relationship while still enabling the media and journalists to continue their important work of
                                    reporting the crime. We can guarantee a newspaper that reports on a terrorist attack
                                    as a “cowardist attack” will not be used as a recruitment poster by these terrorist
                                    organisations!
                                    <br /><br />
                                    If the UN is able to adopt the term "cowardism", the media agencies around the globe will also
                                    begin to refer to terrorism using that new term. This will then drive the adoption of terms such as
                                    “cowardism”, “cowardist attack” or “cowardist bomber” at a global scale! The impact of this on
                                    terrorist organisations is obvious: they will find it harder and harder to find inspiration for these
                                    attacks! They will then gradually see the benefit in abandoning their cowardly tactics and to seek
                                    resolution through legitimate political engagement.

Referring to ISIS as a "cowardist organisation" would be considered as more stigmatising than labelling it as a "terrorist organisation". As one of the functions of criminal law is to stigmatise the crime, it is important that we use a term that is unambiguous in its capacity to stigmatise the crime.

The term of "Cowardism" is a clear acknowledgement of the fact that the perpetrator is using the cowardly tactic of killing and maiming unarmed civilians, children…etc while avoiding direct military engagement. This cowardly nature of the attack is currently not part of the semantics and symbolism of the term "terrorism". This has led to misleading interpretations of the term "terrorism", even to the extent where it is seen as an courageous attempt by the perpetrator to bring about justice. However, more and more people are now seeing past this disguise of "courage" which is cleverly designed to mask the underlying cowardice nature of the attack. And it is no coincidence that more and more people are using the terms "cowardly attack" to describe such terrorist attacks.

                                                                                    <ul>

    Not at all. Once the would-be attacker has been effectively deterred from carrying out cowardist attacks, there is a higher chance that this individual will seek other means of conflict resolution - this could be through legitimate political engagement, protests or other means of expressing dissent through non-violent means. Not only would such action enable the underlying cause to surface, it could generate far more sympathy to their cause than what terrorism could ever have achieved!
<br /><br />
    Power imbalances, socio-economic and political causes exists in every society. However, terrorism is not the answer in resolving any of those underlying causes. Hence the rejection of terrorism would inevitably lead to the opening up of other avenues for these individuals to express their discontent and plight. This will in turn lead to more stable societies that are able to better acknowledge and address these underlying causes.

                                                            We are Sri Lankans but we are also citizens of the world - we dream of the day when the world has stamped out the scourge that is
                                                            cowardism! We believe this is within everyone's reach - and within our generation!
