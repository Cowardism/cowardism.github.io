                                <br>It has become apparent that the word "terrorism" does not accurately reflect the true nature of that horrendous crime. Instead, it seems to glorify the crime due to the symbolism associated with that word – whenever the media reports on such horrendous acts as “terrorism”, the terrorist groups seem to take great pride in hearing it. In fact, that word itself serves as propaganda for the terrorist organisations.
                                <br>
                                <br>What is the true nature of the crime which we currently refer to as "terrorism"? Is it not the cowardly act of killing of innocent and unarmed civilians – including children? Let's take a closer look at the meaning behind the word "cowardly". The English Oxford dictionary defines "cowardly" as:
                            </p>
                            <div class="dictionary-quote">
                                <strong>cowardly:</strong>
                                <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                                    <span style="font-style: italic;">adjective.</span> 1. Lacking courage. 2 (of an action) carried out against a person who is unable to retaliate. <span style="font-style: italic;">"a cowardly attack on a helpless victim"</span>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                Based on the second definition above, we propose the introduction of 2 new words into our vocabulary we believe would better represent the crime and the criminal: “cowardism” and “cowardist”:
                            </p>
                            <div class="dictionary-quote">
                                <strong>cowardist:</strong>
                                <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                                    <span style="font-style: italic;">noun.</span> A person that carries out a cowardly attack on unarmed civilians as means of coercion.
                                </div>
                                <div style="height: 0.7em;"></div>
                                <strong>cowardism:</strong>
                                <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                                    <span style="font-style: italic;">noun.</span> Violent action carried out through cowardly attacks on unarmed civilians as means of coercion.
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                The new words proposed above are derived using the second definition of "cowardly". But does the first definition, "Lacking courage" also apply to cowardists? After all, aren’t they courageous enough to take their own lives for whatever cause they believe it? The fact is, we will never fully understand the corrupted state of mind of a cowardist. Besides any brainwashing they may have undergone, cowardists are also known to use drugs such as Captagon to induce “chemical courage” right before carrying out an attack (see "References" section below for more information). Regardless of the perceived “courage” or their disguised cowardice, the terms “cowardists” and “cowardism” primarily refers to the carrying out of cowardly attacks on unarmed civilians.
                            </p>

                            <br />
                            <p>
                                Most cowardists are known to be depressed individuals that have suffered some injustice in the past or have failed in their pursuits in life. They are easily recruited by cowardist organisations (eg ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Boko-Haram...etc) and they begin to realise being a “terrorist” is an easy path to notoriety. They allow themselves to believe that this killing of unarmed civilians can be justified. No matter how they have been brainwashed, the killing of innocent civilians without giving them any opportunity to defend themselves is simply a cowardly act – <span style="font-style: italic;">cowardism</span>.
                                <br />

                                <h2 style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">Let's Change our Vocabulary</h2>
                                We are advocating a change in our vocabulary whenever we refer to “terrorism” or “terrorists” – we believe “cowardism” or “cowardists” are more appropriate as:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Our language is full of symbolism – words such as “terrorism” has the contradictory connotation of glorifying the crime of attacking soft targets (eg unarmed civilians in a mall, church or airport). The use of such words serves as propaganda for the terrorist organisations and inspires new recruits. </li>
                                <li>The word “cowardism” on the other hand, recognises those attacks on innocent civilians without glorifying the crime. </li>
                                <li>Once terms such as “cowardism”, “cowardist attack” or “cowardist bomber” start to become commonly used by the public at a global scale – the terrorist organisations will find it harder and harder to find inspiration for these attacks – even if they continue to refer to these by other names such as “Jihad” or “martyrdom”. The symbolism of the language used by the public will always have overarching influence.</li>
                            </ul>

                                            Given words such as “terrorism” and “terrorists” are so widely used, is it possible for us to bring about a change in our vocabulary to refer to terrorism using a word that is more befitting of the crime - <span style="font-style: italic;">“cowardism”</span>? To do this, we will need a change of perspective at a global scale!

For example, school and workplace bullying can be tackled just by asking "Are you being a bully?". The correct labelling and recognition of that unacceptable behaviour is usually enough to deter the bully. Similarly, the recognition of cowardly killing of unarmed civilians through use of the word "cowardism" will make that crime less inspiring for future terrorists. However, this needs to be a global movement and involves the media also applying the correct vocabulary when reporting such crime.

                                            We are a non-profit organisation that was established on 24th of April 2019 - just couple of days after Sri Lanka was cowardly attacked on Easter Sunday.
                                            We are Sri Lankans but we are also citizens of the world - we dream of the day when the world has stamped out the scourge that is
                                            cowardism! We believe this is within everyone's reach - and within our generation!
                                        </p>
