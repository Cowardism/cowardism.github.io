                                Many nations have grappled with terrorism for decades without truly understanding what keeps fuelling it. Governments have promised to eliminate it by investing millions of dollars in security and various counter-terrorism measures. Though these tactics work momentarily, it only seems to inspire another group of terrorists to carry out similar attacks elsewhere.
                                <br /> <br />We believe there is a much simpler solution - which doesn’t cost a penny! A simple change that each of us can do NOW that will herald the beginning of the end to what we currently call “terrorism”… It starts with the use of correct vocabulary.

                                <br /><br />

                            <p>
                                It has become apparent that the word "terrorism" does not reflect the true nature of that horrendous crime. Instead, it seems to glorify the crime due to the symbolism associated with that word – whenever the media reports on such horrendous acts as “terrorism”, the terrorist groups seem to take great pride in hearing it. In fact, that word itself serves as propaganda for the terrorist organisations. Many do not realise that whenever the media refers to it as "terrorism", they are actually throwing gasoline on the fire: It further inspires would-be terrorists around the globe.
                                <br>
                                <br>What is the true nature of the crime which we currently refer to as "terrorism"? Is it not the cowardly act of killing of innocent and unarmed civilians – including children? Let's take a closer look at the meaning behind the word "cowardly". The English Oxford dictionary defines "cowardly" as:
                            </p>
                            <div class="dictionary-quote">
                                <strong>cowardly:</strong>
                                <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                                    <span style="font-style: italic;">adjective.</span> 1. Lacking courage. 2 (of an action) carried out against a person who is unable to retaliate. <span style="font-style: italic;">"a cowardly attack on a helpless victim"</span>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                Based on that definition, we propose the introduction of 2 new words into our vocabulary which we believe are better alternatives to "terrorist" and "terrorism":
                            </p>
                            <div class="dictionary-quote">
                                <strong>cowardist:</strong>

                            <h2 style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">Let's Change our Vocabulary</h2>
                            We are advocating a change in our vocabulary whenever we refer to “terrorism” or “terrorists” – we believe “cowardism” or “cowardists” are more appropriate as:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Our language is full of symbolism – words such as “terrorism” has the contradictory connotation of glorifying the crime of attacking soft targets (eg unarmed civilians in a mall, church or airport). The use of such words serves as propaganda for the terrorist organisations and inspires new recruits. </li>
                                <li>The word “cowardism” on the other hand, recognises those attacks on innocent civilians without glorifying the crime. </li>
                                <li>Once terms such as “cowardism”, “cowardist attack” or “cowardist bomber” start to become commonly used by the public at a global scale – the terrorist organisations will find it harder and harder to find inspiration for these attacks – even if they continue to refer to these by other names such as “Jihad” or “martyrdom”. The symbolism of the language used by the public will always have overarching influence.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                Some would remark: "cowardists don't really seem to be cowards" – after all, aren’t they couragous enough to sacrifice their lives for their cause? The fact is, we will never fully understand the corrupted state of mind of a cowardist. Besides any brainwashing they may have undergone, cowardists are also known to use drugs to induce “chemical courage” right before carrying out an attack (eg drugs such as "Jihad pills" are rampant among ISIS operatives - see "References" section below).   Regardless of the perceived “courage” or their disguised cowardice, the terms “cowardists” and “cowardism” primarily refer to the carrying out of cowardly attacks on unarmed civilians.
                            </p>

                            <br />
                            <p>
                                Most cowardists are known to be depressed individuals that have suffered some injustice in the past or have failed in their pursuits in life. They are easily recruited by cowardist organisations (eg ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Boko-Haram...etc) and they begin to realise being a “terrorist” is an easy path to notoriety. They allow themselves to believe that this killing of unarmed civilians can be justified. No matter how they have been brainwashed, the killing of innocent civilians without giving them any opportunity to defend themselves is simply a cowardly act – <span style="font-style: italic;">cowardism</span>.

                                            Given words such as “terrorism” and “terrorists” are so widely used, is it possible for us to bring about a change in our vocabulary to refer to terrorism using a word that is more befitting of the crime - <span style="font-style: italic;">“cowardism”</span>? To do this, we will need a change of perspective at a global scale!
                                            We believe this can be done with your help!

                                            <br><br>Here is our ambitious goal which we hope to achieve in 2019 - <strong>"Global Campaign 2019"</strong>:

                                            </strong>
                                        </p>

                                            The media will only use these new words if they have become mainstream in our written/spoken language! This is where we need your help: Please spread our message through social media and begin using these new words in all your personal interactions - so these new words can start to enter into the mainstream! We need to make this message go viral <u>now</u> if we can ever hope for the media to pick it up in 3 months' time!!!
                                            <br />
                                            <br>Here are some of the examples of vocabulary changes we’re hoping to see reported in the media and enter into our common spoken language:
                                            <br>
                                        </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>“terrorist” to be only referred to as “cowardist”</li>
                                            <li>“suicide bomber” to be only referred to as “cowardist bomber”</li>
                                            <li>“terrorism” to be only referred to as “cowardism”</li>
                                            <li>“terrorist organisations” to be only referred to as “cowardist organisations”</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>
                                            <br />
                                            We believe if we can achieve a penetration of these new words to at least 30% of our population through social media, that alone will be sufficient to create a "snowball" effect to drive it through to the rest of the population. This is due to peer pressure factors: those that still continue to use words such as "terrorism" will be seen as supporters of terrorism. Eventually, they will feel obliged to also start using the new words to ensure there is no such perception. We believe such a global change in our vocabulary will drive the eradication of terrorism as we know it.

                                            We are a non-profit organisation that was established on 24th of April 2019 - just couple of days after Sri Lanka was cowardly attacked on Easter Sunday.
                                            We are Sri Lankans but we are also citizens of the world - we dream of the day when the world has stamped out the scourge that is
                                            cowardism! We believe this is within everyone's reach - and within our generation!

                                        </p>
