                                Terrorism has claimed countless number of innocent lives and have impacted on economies
                                across the globe. Many nations have grappled with terrorism for decades without truly understanding
                                what keeps fuelling it.
                                And the frequency of such terrorist attacks has significantly increased over the last
                                decade<a href="#references"><sup>1</sup></a>. It is more important now than ever for us to
                                understand what drives terrorism and what we can do to stamp it out!
                                <br /><br />
                                We believe the first step in tackling terrorism is understanding the issues in categorising
                                this heinous crime under the label of “terrorism”. Currently as it stands, there is no internationally
                                accepted definition of “terrorism”. The UN has been attempting to define “terrorism” for over two decades
                                now, but is yet to reach consensus on the definition. The primary disagreement seems to be in distinguishing
                                terrorism from legitimate liberation movements. In 2010, the Head of the UN Counter-Terrorism
                                Committee Executive Directorate had said “nations are hampered by an inability to define and criminalise
                                terrorism”<a href="#references"><sup>2</sup></a>. Unfortunately, this remains an issue today!

                                <div class="separator transparent"></div>
                                <p style="color: black !important;">
                                    The definition of the term “terrorism” is highly subjective depending on the political party or
                                    ideological group that is defining it. The well known slogan "One man’s terrorist is another man’s
                                    freedom fighter” highlights the subjectiveness of the term. From an international criminal law perspective,
                                    Dr Ben Saul (professor of international law at the University of Sydney), has noted that the term “currently
                                    lacks the precision, objectivity and certainty demanded by legal discourse”<a href="#references"><sup>3</sup></a>.
                                    The political and emotional connotation of the term also makes it difficult for it to be admitted
                                    into international law.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Furthermore, criminal law needs to be able clearly express condemnation of the crime and to stigmatise the
                                    perpetrator. But does the label “terrorism” have sufficient capacity to stigmatise the crime? From
                                    the perspective of the terrorist organisation and their sympathisers, the term “terrorism” is
                                    synonymous with terms such as “freedom fighters” or “jihadists”. This combined with the conflicting
                                    and subjective definitions of the term “terrorism”, one would conclude that the term would be
                                    ineffective in stigmatising the crime. This is in stark contrast to the significant levels of
                                    stigmatication that is associated with other crime labels such as murder, rape, child molestation,
                                    manslaughter…etc.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Instead of stigmatising the crime, many believe the term “terrorism” in fact glorifies the crime! Osama Bin
                                    Laden has said “The terrorism we practice is of the most commendable kind for it is directed at
                                    tyrants…”. ISIS have openly created online resources that encourage “terrorism” - proudly using that
                                    same term. It seems the term in itself has now become part of the propaganda of terrorist
                                    organisations!
                                    <br /><br />
                                    It is clear that what is needed is a better term that can be used to objectively categorise this horrendous
                                    crime without any political bias, and without any doubt in terms of its
                                    capacity to stigmatise the crime...

                                <p>
                                    <br>What is the true nature of the crime which we currently refer to as “terrorism”? Is it not the cowardly act of killing/injuring innocent and unarmed civilians – including children? Let's take a closer look at the meaning behind the word “cowardly”. The English Oxford dictionary defines “cowardly” as:
                                </p>
                                <div class="dictionary-quote">
                                    <strong>cowardly:</strong>
                                    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                                        <span style="font-style: italic;">adjective.</span> 1. Lacking courage. 2 (of an action) carried out against a person who is unable to retaliate. <span style="font-style: italic;">“a cowardly attack on a helpless victim”</span>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <br />
                                <p>
                                    Based on that definition, we propose the introduction of 2 new words into our vocabulary which we believe are better alternatives to “terrorism” and “terrorist”:
                                </p>
                                <div class="dictionary-quote">
                                    <strong>cowardism:</strong>
                                    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">

                                    <strong>cowardist:</strong>
                                    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                                        <span style="font-style: italic;">noun.</span> A person that carries out a cowardly attack that is targeting unarmed civilians as means of coercion.

                                <p>
                                    Note 1: The term “cowardly” is used here to signify that it is a deliberate attack on unarmed civilians or
                                    non-combatants - those who are unable to retaliate or defend themselves. It is also “cowardly” in the sense that the perpetrator
                                    is avoiding direct engagement with the military – and choosing to attack soft targets instead.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Note 2: The term “cowardly” is referencing from the point of view of an observer/witness of the crime,
                                    not the point of view of the perpetrator. That is, whether the perpetrator internally believes he/she
                                    is cowardly or courageous has no bearing at all on this definition. But from an observer's perspective,
                                    there should be no doubt of the cowardly nature of the attack given that unarmed civilians are the victims
                                    of the attack.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Note 3: This definition has no mention of what is the reason for the “coercion”. That is, it applies
                                    for all types of coercion whether it be political, religious, ideological driven, self-determination
                                    driven...etc.  Any cowardly attack to kill or maim civilians is to be regarded
                                    as unjustified no matter what the cause. If a self-determination, rebellion or a revolutionary
                                    movement has to resort to cowardism, that movement should then be deemed to be in violation of international human rights!

                                    Terrorism expert Walter Laqueur believes the term “terrorism” needs to be replaced: “The term
                                    terrorism has come to encompass such wide varieties of violent acts that it should be replaced
                                    by another term”<a href="#references"><sup>4</sup></a>. Not only is it a disputed term, it also does not have the capacity
                                    to sufficiently stigmatize the crime or to express the public's disgust of the cowardly attack
                                    on unarmed civilians. In fact, we’d argue that it glorifies the crime!

                                        We are advocating the use of the term “Cowardism” to be used instead of “Terrorism” – In fact, we
                                        believe that it is not possible for us to win the war against terrorism until we do so! Clear arguments for this change in
                                        vocabulary:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                                        <li style="color: black !important; list-style-type: square;">The term “cowardism” has significantly more capacity to stigmatise the crime than the disputed term “terrorism”.</li>
                                        <li style="color: black !important; list-style-type: square;">The term “cowardism” is not subjective and not open for interpretation. It is simply an attack targeting unarmed civilians as means of coercion. It doesn’t attempt to qualify the reasons behind the coercion and doesn’t discriminate on whether the perpetrator is a state or non-state actor.</li>
                                        <li style="color: black !important; list-style-type: square;">The term “cowardism” will clearly convey the public’s disgust and condemnation of this crime. Even if terrorist organisations refer to these attacks by other names such as “martyrdom operations” or "jihad", the strong symbolism associated with the term “cowardist” (when wielded by the public, media and through criminal law) will always have overarching influence to deter the execution of such attacks.</li>
                                        <li style="color: black !important; list-style-type: square;">The UN has been unable to define this heinous act using the term “terrorism” after more than 20 years of negotiations! But the global community is now demanding a solution – we cannot afford to waste another 20 years arguing on semantics!</li>

                                    How would the term "Cowardism" lead to the beginning of the end to Terrorism?
                                </h2>
                                <p>
                                    <br />
                                    It is well known that terrorists seek publicity through their acts of violence<a href="#references"><sup>5</sup></a>. Coincidentally,
                                    a symbiotic relationship can often be observed between media and terrorist organisations<a href="#references"><sup>6</sup></a>. As
                                    Prof Taha Najem has pointed out "The broader and more prolonged the media coverage of terrorism turns
                                    out to be, the greater the terrorists' feelings of accomplishment, influence, and power".
                                    <br /><br />
                                    We believe the use of the term "cowardism" instead of "terrorism" will break this symbiotic
                                    relationship while still enabling the media and journalists to do their important work of
                                    reporting on this heinous crime. We can guarantee a newspaper that reports on a terrorist attack
                                    as a "cowardist attack" will not be used as a recruitment poster by these terrorist
                                    organisations! Once media starts to use terms such as “cowardism”, “cowardist attack” or
                                    “cowardist bomber” at a global scale, the terrorist organisations will find it harder and
                                    harder to find inspiration for these attacks!
                                    <br /><br />
                                    If both criminal law and the media can adopt the term "cowardism", we believe it will lead
                                    to the beginning of the end to "terrorism" as we know it! These cowardist organisations will
                                    see benefit in abandoning their cowardly tactics and to seek resolution through legitimate political
                                    engagement.

                                            Given words such as “terrorism” and “terrorists” are so widely used, is it possible for us to bring about a change in our vocabulary to use words that are more befitting of the crime - <span style="font-style: italic;">“cowardism”</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">“cowardists”</span>? To do this, we will need a change of perspective at a global scale!

                                        <p>
                                            We are a non-profit organisation that was established on 24th of April 2019 - just couple of days after Sri Lanka was cowardly attacked on Easter Sunday.
                                            We are Sri Lankans but we are also citizens of the world - we dream of the day when the world has stamped out the scourge that is
                                            cowardism! We believe this is within everyone's reach - and within our generation!

                                        </p>
